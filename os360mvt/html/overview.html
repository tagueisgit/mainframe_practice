<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<h4><a name="1.1">1.1 What is Hercules?</a></h4>
<p>Hercules is an emulator for the IBM System/370,
ESA/390, and z/Architecture mainframes. The goal of the project is
to build an emulator that runs on Linux, Windows, and any other Unix-style
OS, capable of running any IBM operating system and program. Check out the
<a href="http://www.conmicro.cx/hercules">Hercules home
page</a> for all the details, and join the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hercules-390">Hercules mailing
list</a> at Yahoo! Groups to get in on the discussion of the system. There's
also a group, <a 
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hercules-os360">hercules-os360</a>,
dedicated to discussion of OS/360 on Hercules. Updates to this document
will be announced there.</p>
<h4><a name="1.2">1.2 What is OS/360?</a></h4>
<p>OS/360 is the operating system IBM intended all along to be what people
ran on their System/360 mainframe line. It's a famous case of software
taking much, much longer to deliver than anyone had planned or hoped, and
was quite buggy when it was first released. Fred Brooks was a manager at IBM
on the OS/360 project, and his classic work on software engineering, <i>The
Mythical Man-Month</i>, is based on his experiences with that project.<p>
<p>OS/360 came in three flavors: PCP, MFT, and MVT. PCP (Primary Control
Program) was the simplest, capable of only running one task at a time. MFT
(Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks) could, as the name implies,
run several things simultaneously, but the number was fixed by a limit set
when the system was built. MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of
Tasks) removed the build-time restriction on how much could be run at once;
instead, the limit was how much could be squeezed into the host computer's
memory and CPU resources. MVT is the most capable of the three flavors, and
the one we'll be getting to run.</p>
<p>OS/360 lives on even today, greatly enhanced and improved, as z/OS.
Over the years, it has been transformed to the point that very little to
none of the actual OS/360 code still is used, but the basic design
is still very much intact, and many of the features of MVT will be readily
recognizable to an MVS, OS/390, or z/OS systems programmer. This
is especially true of the HASP job control and spooling system, which
is the forerunner of today's JES2.</p>
<h4><a name="1.3">1.3 What are we trying to accomplish?</a></h4>
<p>The goal here is to have a running OS/360 MVT system, with as many of the
features as can be made to work. In particular, TSO (Time Sharing Option,
the interactive terminal subsystem), and the FORTRAN, PL/1, COBOL, ALGOL,
and RPG compilers are included. Since MVT doesn't have virtual storage, and
since Hercules is a software-based emulator, it won't handle a really huge
workload, but it's definitely adequate for systems hacking and
demonstration.</p>
<h4><a name="1.4">1.4 Overview of the process</a></h4>
<p>Getting from the raw source materials to a running system is
straightforward, but somewhat involved. The Hercules emulator is
installed. A small MFT system, referred to as the "driving system", is
constructed, and used to build the actual MVT "target system". This is done
in two steps: stage 1, which takes a machine-readable description of the
target system's hardware and software and builds the jobs necessary to
construct it, and stage 2, which uses the output of stage 1 to do the
actual work. After stage 2 is complete, a small amount of final preparation
is done, and the target system is IPLed and run. HASP and TSO/TCAM are then
loaded and generated. At this point, the system is ready to do work.</p>
