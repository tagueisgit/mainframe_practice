<h3>5. Getting ready for stage 1</h3>
<h4><a name="5.1">5.1 General information about running MFT</a></h4>
<p>We're finished with the work that can be done outside of the driving
system. From here on, everything will be dome from the driving system by
running jobs. Some basics of running MFT:
<ul>
<li>On the pregenerated system, you can only run two things at a time. The
tasks are designated as P0 and P1. If something's running in P0 and you try
to start something else, nothing will appear to happen. Nothing's broken,
though, and the second thing to be started will run when the first one's
finished.</li>
<li>Jobs are read into the system from a virtual card reader, with a task
called <code>RDR</code>. In the supplied config files, the reader is defined
at address 00C. Output is written to a printer by a writer task called
<code>WTR</code>; the printer is defined at address 00E, and printed output
will show up in the file <code>prt00e.txt</code> as it's written. Cards
punched by the virtual card punch will appear in the file
<code>pch00d.txt</code>.</li>
<li>Basically, to run each job, you do:<br>
<code>devinit 00c</code> <i>filename</i> (in the command line control panel,
or)<br> <code>n</code> <i>deviceID filename</i> (in the semi-graphical
control panel)<br>.
This command is issued in the Hercules control panel to point the virtual
card reader at the file you need to run. The reader automagically
detects if the input file is ASCII or EBCDIC, and does any translation
that might be needed.</li>
<li>You will see messages of the form:<br>
<code>&nbsp;IEF234E R </code><i>addr</i><code>,</code><i>volser</i><code>,RDR
P01<br>
*IEF233A M </code><i>addr</i><code>,SCRTCH,,RDR,P1  P01</code><br>
This is a mount needed message. On a real system, the operator would see
this, physically put the appropriate disk pack in the drive called out in
the message, then press a button on the drive to cause an interrupt and tell
OS/360 that the volume is now available. While Hercules disk volumes are
interchangeable, there's no need to do that, since there are enough drives
to go around, so instead, we can avoid the necessity of doing it more than
once on a given drive by:
<ul>
<li><code>m
</code><i>addr</i><code>,vol=(sl,</code><i>volser</i><code>),use=private</code><br>
This command to MFT tells the operating system to leave the volume named
<i>volser</i> on the drive with the address <i>addr</i> for the life of the
current execution, or until the operator makes it available again by
unmounting the volume. If the <i>volser</i> is <code>WORK</code><i>xx</i>,
use <code>public</code> instead of <code>private</code> in the command.</li>
<li><code>i</code> <i>addr</i>(in the command line control panel, or)<br>
<code>u</code> <i>deviceID</i>(in the semi-graphical control panel)<br>
This command in the Hercules console window simulates the interrupt button.
Until you issue it, MFT will assume the volume is not yet available and not
do anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your system is sitting there, not doing anything, it's probably
waiting for a reply to a mount request. See the preceding paragraph.
</ul></p>
<h4><a name="5.2">5.2 IPLing the driving system</a></h4>
<p>To start MFT:
<ul>
<li><code>hercules -f gen.cnf</code><br>
This command, at a Linux or Windows command prompt, or in a Mac OS X
Terminal window, starts the Hercules emulator and tells it the list of
devices to use. This window is now the Hercules control panel. You'll see a
list of available disk devices, and then a message:<br>
<code>HHCTE003I Waiting for console connection on port 3270</code></li>
<li>Now, connect a telnet client in another window or virtual console - or
another computer, if you like - to the system console. From Linux, do:<br>
<code>telnet localhost 3270</code><br>
On Windows 2000 or XP, the standard telnet client has problems; use another
program, such as TeraTerm Pro or putty. (If you're connecting from another
system, the idea is to connect a telnet client to port 3270 on the host
system you're running Hercules on.) You'll be greeted with a banner telling
you that you've connected to Hercules, along with the version and console
address.<br>
The supplied config file (and the one for the running MVT system, too) are
set to use a time zone offset of -6 hours, to change a system GMT clock to
US Central Standard Time. If you run your system clock on local time, or
don't live in the central US, you'll want to change this to reflect your
time zone. MFT doesn't use the TOD clock, so that's not important now, but
MVT does, and things will look funny if you don't change it.</li>
<li><code>ipl 150</code> (command line control panel, or)<br>
<code>l</code> <i>deviceID</i> (semi-graphical control panel)<br>
in the Hercules control panel. Load and start (IPL, for Initial Program
Load) the operating system. There will be a lot of activity, messages flying
by, none of which you really care about (they're useful for debugging).
Eventually, you'll be greeted with:<br>
<code>IEA218I MOD=50 ASSUMED S360<br>
IEA101A  SPECIFY SYSTEM PARAMETERS FOR RELEASE 21.0  MFT</code><br>
on the MFT console (the telnet session). Except for the commands noted above
for setting up the card reader and disk drives, all other commands will be
issued at this session.</li>
<li><i>(just hit enter)</i><br>
This tells MFT that you don't want to change any of the basic system
parameters. You'll see, next:<br>
<code>IEA217I SEREP INTERFACE ESTABLISHED<br>
*00 IEE801D CHANGE PARTITIONS- REPLY YES/NO (,LIST)</code><br>
The system wants to know if you want to change the default partition
sizes.</li>
<li><code>r 00,yes</code><br>
You do want to change them, mainly because the default size for the P0
partition is small enough that you can't do any useful work there. The
system will acknowledge your request with:<br>
<code>&nbsp;IEE866I DEFINE COMMAND BEING PROCESSED<br>
*00 IEE802A ENTER DEFINITION</code></li>
<li><code>r 00,p0=(a,512k),p1=(a,512k),end</code><br>
This defines two partitions (the maximum allowed in the starter system),
both with 512K of memory maximum. This isn't as restrictive as it sounds. In
the era of OS/360, a single machine with 512K of memory was huge. (Your
virtual system, a 370/158, has 2 MB of memory.) Most programs were written
to run comfortably in much smaller regions of memory. A 128K partition was
sufficient to run nearly anything except the ANS COBOL or FORTRAN H
compilers.<br>
The system will respond with a couple of messages about defining things,
then:<br>
<code>&nbsp;IEE101A READY</code><br>
It's lying: it's not ready to do work yet, but it's not far from it.</li>
<li><code>t date=</code><i>yy.ddd</i><code>,q=(,f)</code><br>
This command tells MFT what today's date is. Since it dates from the late
1960s, it's not anything resembling Y2K compliant; you'll have to pick a
date in the past. I recommend the correct current day number, and using the
year 1975 instead of the year 2003; this makes the dates work right,
including the right day of the week and the fact that it's a leap year. The
<code>q=(,f)</code> is only needed the first time you IPL the system after
building the system IPL volume; it tells the system to initialize the
dataset used for job control. If that's specified, you'll get:<br>
<code>*00 IEF423A SPECIFY JOB QUEUE PARAMETERS</code><br>
Reply to this with:<br>
<code>r 00,u</code><br>
to accept the defaults. The system will run for about 30 seconds, and
eventually come to a wait state when it's done.</li>
<li><code>mn jobnames,t<br>
mn status</code><br>
These two commands will make the system produce progress messages on the
console as jobs start and finish, and set up datasets for use. They will
produce no output themselves.</li>
<li><code>s wtr.p0,00e</code><br>
This starts the WTR task in P0. You'll see a couple of progress messages,
and then:<br>
<code>&nbsp;IEF868I 00E WTR WAITING FOR WORK P00</code><br>
The writer is ready to do its job. It'll sit there quietly in the background
until you stop it. There's no real need to stop it.</li>
<li><code>s init.p1,,,a</code><br>
This tells MFT to run available jobs submitted with <code>CLASS=A</code> in
P1. It doesn't actually start anything, but rather allows other things to
start themselves. It will produce no messages by itself.</li>
<li><code>s rdr.p1,00c</code><br>
This tells MFT to start the RDR process to read in the cards. The RDR task
will start, produce a mount request (which you need to reply to as
described above), then put up an I/O error message. It's complaining that
it has no cards to read. This is normal. When you do the <code>devinit</code>
or <code>n</code> command, the reader will see that it has cards to read and
read them.</li>
</ul>
MFT is now ready to do work.</p>
<h4><a name="5.3">5.3 Cataloging work datasets: CTLGWRK</a></h4>
<p>The first job that you'll need to run is CTLGWRK. It has two steps:
<ul>
<li><code>CTLGWRK</code>: This step catalogs the work datasets so stage 2
can find them.</li>
<li><code>MAKECTLG</code>: This step creates and initializes the system
catalog on the target MVT system.</li>
</ul>
The job is in <code>jcl/ctlgwrk.jcl</code>.</p>
<h4><a name="5.4">5.4 Cataloging DLIBs: CTLG3330</a></h4>
<p>This job has just one step. It adds the DLIB datasets to the driving
system's master catalog. The job is in <code>jcl/ctlg3330.jcl</code>.</p>
<h4><a name="5.5">5.5 Selecting the right IEAANIP: FIXNIP</a></h4>
<p>This job corrects a problem in the <code>SYS1.MODGEN2</code> dataset on
the CD: As supplied, it has a modified <code>IEAANIP</code> macro, which
builds the Nucleus Initialization Program. The modified code will not build
with the rest of the system on the CD. Forutnately, the original version is
still there; this job switches it in place of the unusable one. The job is
in <code>jcl/fixnip.jcl</code>.</p>
<h4><a name="5.6">5.6 Fixing GENLIB macros: FIXGENLB</a></h4>
<p>The supplied <code>SYS1.GENLIB</code> has several modifications from the
standard version. While most of them are harmless, and several are actually
good, they assume an environment that doesn't apply completely here. This
job changes the source macros to eliminate the problems, and the need to
manually edit the stage 2 deck once generated. The job is in
<code>jcl/fixgenlb.jcl</code>. It makes all possible updates in place on
<code>SYS1.GENLIB</code>, but two changes require a new member, so the
dataset is allocated with extra space to accomodate that by
<code>makedasd</code>.</p>
<h4><a name="5.7">5.7 Installing hooks for HASP: HASPHOOK</a></h4>
<p>HASP is an add-on package, not part of OS/360 proper. It was developed
independently at the IBM Federal Systems Division in Houston. (Hence the
name, Houston Automatic Spooling Package.) As such, it needed a few
additions to the standard OS/360 programs. Most of those additions are
already in place, but two others need to be added to make the OS/360 I/O
subsystem call HASP at critical points in processing. Three system
generation macros also need to be replaced. (They cannot be updated, since
they do not have complete line numbering.) This job, in
<code>jcl/hasphook.jcl</code>, adds those hooks.</p>
