<h3>13. Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge the following folks who have contributed to the
work so far on Hercules and OS/360:
<ul>
<li>Roger Bowler, Jan Jaeger, and the rest of the Hercules team, of course;
without their work on Hercules, we wouldn't have anything to play with.</li>
<li>Rick Fochtman, for finding the OS/360 stuff and making the CD
available.</li>
<li>Jack Schudel, for finding a copy of HASP.</li>
<li>Frank Pajerski, Sam Golob, and Sam Knutson, for keeping old copies of
mods tapes around and available.</li>
<li>Kevin Leonard, who did the hard work of figuring out how to make the
HASP 4.0 retrofit work. Greg Smith contributed debugging assistance. Gregg
Berg found the cause of the persistent S200 ABEND, and Kevin squashed the
bug once and for all.</li>
<li>Malcolm Beattie and Mike Ross, for getting TSO and TCAM built.</li>
<li>Tony Harminc and Glen Herrmannsfeldt, whose experienced advice on
different parts of the process have helped immensely.</li>
<li>Dutch Owen, who discovered many of the problems with MVT so I didn't
have to.</li>
<li>Alex Friis and Giorgio De Nunzio, for making the OS/360 CD available for
me to grab before I got my copy.</li>
<li>Chris Craft, who found some early inconsistencies between what the docs
should have said and what they actually did say, and spotted the control
files I left out of the original copy of <code>os360ctl.tar.gz</code>.</li>
<li>Aron Eisenpress came up with a copy of the original
<code>SYS1.DFORTLIB</code>.
<li>The rest of the hercules-390 mailing list, for playing with the system
and offering comments as they did.</li>
</ul>
