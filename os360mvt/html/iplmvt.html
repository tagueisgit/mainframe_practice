<h3>9. IPLing MVT</h3>
<p>Here's the system log from a sample IPL of MVT I did. I'll explain what's
going on at each step. On the 3270 console, the input area is separate from
the display area; I'll show the output from each command indented, and the
input over to the left and in italics.</p>
<p>After starting Hercules with <code>hercules -f mvt.cnf</code>, connecting
a tn3270 session (not a regular telnet session, as you did for MFT), and
telling it to <code>ipl 350</code>, the console comes back with:
<pre>
      IEA218I MOD=158, ALTSYS=350 ASSUMED S370
      IEA101A  SPECIFY SYSTEM PARAMETERS FOR RELEASE 21.8F MVT
</pre>
As before, just hit enter. If you see the message
<pre>
      IEA100I TIMER IS NOT WORKING
</pre>
before the other two, it's possible that your Hercules system is fast enough
to confuse the timer detection code in MVT. If it's not a lot faster than
my 500 MHz laptop, stop the system and re-IPL; chances are that it'll go
away. If not, then the other option is to change the 100000 in the
FIXGENLB job, step SGIEA2NP, to something larger; I suggest that you
multiply that number by the difference in speed between your system and
mine as a starting point. In any case, if that message is issued, you will
not be able to set the console to roll-delete mode.<br>
The system may issue the message:
<pre>
      IEA135A SPECIFY SYS1.DUMP TAPE UNIT ADDRESS OR NO
</pre>If it does, enter
<pre>
<i>r 00,'no'</i>
</pre>to turn off the dump function, which will return the message:
<pre>
      IEA208I  SYS1.DUMP            FUNCTION INOPERATIVE
</pre>
This time, assuming all is working well, things are a bit more verbose:
<pre>
      IEE140I SYSTEM CONSOLES                     
        CONSOLE/ALT  COND AUTH     ID AREA  ROUTCD
          01E/0C0     H   STCMDS   03       ALL   
          0C0/01F     M   ALL      01 Z,A   ALL   
          01F/0C0     A   ALL      02       ALL   
          01E/0C0     A   NONE     03       NONE  
     *IEA000A  01F,INT REQ,09,0E00,4000,,,        
</pre>The available console devices are listed. Since I didn't connect a
telnet session to the console at 01F, it's complaining; this can be ignored.
<pre>
      IEE101A READY                               
     *00 IEE114A DATE=75.043,CLOCK=20.08.18 - REPLY WITH SET PARAMETERS OR U
</pre>It's not ready yet this time either, but it's trying. Since Hercules
has been told to use an epoch 28 years after the normal OS/360 epoch of 1960,
it thinks that 2003 is really 1975, and finds that acceptable. On a real
system, you could change the hardware TOD clock at this point, but that has
no effect on Hercules, which gets the hardware clock value from the host
system. Before replying to this message, though, there are a couple
of other things that can be done first to make life a little easier.
First, we can monitor job names and status, as we did on MFT:
<pre>
<i>mn jobnames,t
mn status</i>
</pre>Next, we can set the console to roll delete mode. This will make
status and informational messages roll off the screen, while keeping
around important messages that need to have something done about them. The
easy way is to type
<pre>
<i>k s</i>
</pre>and hit ENTER. The command line will be replaced with:
<pre>
  K S,DEL=Y,SEG=09,CON=Y,RNUM=19,RTME=046
</pre>Change it to read:
<pre>
<i>  K S,DEL=rd,SEG=19,CON=n,RNUM=19,RTME=001</i>
</pre>and hit ENTER. The first time you IPL MVT after building the residence volume, you
need to do:
<pre>
<i>r 0,q=(,f)</i>
</pre>and respond U to the <code>IEF423A SPECIFY JOB QUEUE PARAMETERS</code>
message. After the first time, you can simply do:
<pre>
<i>r 0,u</i>
      IEE600I REPLY TO 00 IS; U
      IEE118I SET PARAMETER(S) ACCEPTED
  00  IEF249I FOLLOWING P/R AND RSV VOLUMES ARE MOUNTED
      SYSRES ON 150 (RSV-STR)

      DLIB01 ON 351 (RSV-PRV)                       
      WORK02 ON 352 (RSV-PUB)                       
      IEE037I LOG NOT SUPPORTED.                      
      IEE351I SMF SYS1.MAN RECORDING NOT BEING USED
</pre>The PRESRES member has been applied and the volumes listed have been
marked permanently resident. SMF has been turned off, as was specified
in the SMFDEFLT member.</p>
<p>At this point, the IPL is complete. However, the system can't do any
work yet because it has no reader, writer, or initiators running. Once
HASP has been built, it will provide those functions, but for now, start
them manually:
<pre>
<i>s init</i>
    - IEF403I INIT     STARTED    TIME=20.09.35
      IEF429I INITIATOR 'INIT' WAITING FOR WORK
</pre>An initiator is started, and waits for work to do. Next, start a
writer:
<pre>
<i>s wtr,00e</i>
    - IEF403I WTR      STARTED    TIME=20.10.50
    - IEF236I ALLOC. FOR WTR      00E          
    - IEF237I 00E   ALLOCATED TO IEFRDER       
     *01 IEC123D 00E SPECIFY UCS PARAMETER     
</pre>The system wants to know what character set train is mounted on
the 1403 printer at 00E. We tell it the PN train, which is the standard one,
with a full, if upper-case-only, character set:
<pre>
<i>r 01,pn</i>
      IEE600I REPLY TO 01 IS; PN
</pre>This is the answer it's looking for, and now it, too, waits for
work.<br>
Note that, unlike MFT, MVT uses different reply identifiers for each
operator request. You need to specify the number in your reply so the system
knows what you're replying to.<br>
Finally, start a reader:
<pre>
<i>s rdr,00c</i>
      IEF403I RDR      STARTED    TIME=20.12.14
      IEF236I ALLOC. FOR RDR      00C          
      IEF237I 00C   ALLOCATED TO IEFRDER       
     *IEA000A  00C,INT REQ,02,0E00,1000,,,RDR  
</pre>
The IEA000A message for 00C is not an error, really: it means the reader has
run out of cards to read and is asking for more. You can ignore this one.
The system is now ready to do some real work. Let's see what's active:
<pre>
<i>d a</i>
   IEE102I 20.57.19 ACTIVE DISPLAY      FRAME LAST         F      E     1A
   STRADDR ENDADDR SQA   R  SUBT  NAME1     NAME2     NAME3               
   16322K  00000K  02280    01    MASTER SCHEDULER                        
   16258K  16322K  00328    00    WTR       00E                           
   00000K  00000K  00504    00    INIT                                    
   16194K  16258K  00768    00    RDR       00C                           
</pre>This display is shown in a display area at the bottom of the output
area of the console; other lines will move up to make room. The part that
says <code>FRAME LAST</code> means that no more output is waiting to be
displayed; if it says <code>FRAME 1</code> (or some other number), you can
page through the display by entering <code>k d,f</code>. The display is
erased by entering <code>k e,d</code>.<br>
From the top of the system's 16 MB of memory down, we have the master
scheduler, the <code>WTR</code> task to print on the system printer, and
the <code>RDR</code> task to read cards from the card reader. There's an
initiator at the bottom of memory, waiting to have something to do.</p>
<p>The system considers the intervention required messages that mean the
card reader and alternate console aren't ready to me ones that
it can't delete. To remove them manually, once they scroll to the top
of the screen, enter
<pre>
<i>k e,1</i>
</pre>The topmost line will be rolled off, whether the system would have
deleted it or not.</p>
<p>At this point, jobs may be submitted and executed as they were on
MFT.</p>
