<h3>7. Running the stage 2 sysgen</h3>
<h4><a name="7.1">7.1 A guided tour of the stage 2 deck</a></h4>
<p>The stage 2 deck is made up of eight groups of jobs:
<ul>
<li>Jobs 1 through 48 assemble system components that need to be configured
to match the sysgen specifications.</li>
<li>Jobs 49 through 62 link edit and copy TSO and TCAM to the target
system.</li>
<li>Job 63 is the first of three really big <cods>IEBCOPY</code> jobs to
populate the target system; this one populates
<code>SYS1.MACLIB</code>. Job 64 renames the dataset to its final name.</li>
<li>Jobs 65 through 101 link edit the operating system and support
programs.</li>
<li>Job 102 is the second big <code>IEBCOPY</code>; this one populates
<code>SYS1.LINKLIB</code>, <code>SYS1.SVCLIB</code>, and
<code>SYS1.TELCMLIB</code>. This is the job that will most likely blow up if
any of those datasets are underallocated.</li>
<li>Jobs 103 through 119 link edit the compilers, assembler, libraries, and
the link editor itself.</li>
<li>Job 120 is the third big <code>IEBCOPY</code>; it adds the compilers,
assembler, and link editor to <code>SYS1.LINKLIB</code>, and populates the
language libraries, <code>SYS1.PARMLIB</code>, and
<code>SYS1.PROCLIB</code>. If you've run successfully through this job, then
you're basically set, as the last group is not likely to fail.</li>
<li>Jobs 121 through 124 perform final cleanup. Job 121 runs
<code>IEHIOSUP</code> against the generated <code>SYS1.SVCLIB</code>; job
122 creates two error recording datasets; job 123 adds them to the catalog;
and job 124 renames the generated datasets from their temporary names to the
actual names they'll use during execution of the target MVT system.</li>
</ul>
These job numbers will change as the stage 1 input changes, but all eight
groups of jobs will be present in a full gen.</p>
<h4><a name="7.2">7.2 Running the stage 2 deck</a></h4>
<p>The stage 2 jobstream may be run in the same manner as the other jobs.
You'll probably want to copy it from <code>pch00d.txt</code> to
<code>stage2.jcl</code> first, just to keep things from getting overwritten
when you least expect it. I suggest leaving the P1 initiator running while
you read the deck in; this will result in the jobs being read in one at a
time, then executed before the next one is read in. This process will take
several minutes.</p>
<h4><a name="7.3">7.3 Stage 2 job error handling</a></h4>
<p>None of these jobs are expected to generate complaints. The
<code>ZEND</code> step isn't executed if the associated job ends with
condition code 0, and is if the condition code is greater than 0 (or 4 for
linkedit jobs). Since the <code>ZMSG</code> program referenced in that step
doesn't actually exist, it gets an S806 ABEND. This ABEND isn't itself a
problem, but it indicates something else that might be. If you receive one
of these ABENDs, look over the job's output to determine the reason.</p>
