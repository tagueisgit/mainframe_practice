<h3>2. Getting started</h3>
<h4><a name="2.1">2.1 The host system</a></h4>
<p>Hercules runs on most current Linux distributions, Mac OS X, other
Unix-style systems, and Windows 98 and above. It will make use of multiple
host CPUs if present, and benefits greatly from having enough main memory
to allocate all of the emulated system's cenral storage plus approximately
128 MB for the host OS to use. Hercules can emulate multiple CPUs, but that
function will not be used in the generated MVT system, mainly because
nobody has tested it to see if it works.</p>
<h4><a name="2.2">2.2 Hercules</a></h4>
<p>You'll need the current revision of Hercules. Download it from the <a
href="http://www.conmicro.cx/hercules">Hercules home page</a>. You can
install the prebuilt binaries, if they're available for your host system;
if not, you'll get to build it yourself.</p>
<p>The current version as I write this is 3.02. Earlier 3.x and 2.x versions
will probably work, although 2.16.x is known to have problems with
MVT. 1.x versions will not work with the configuration files shipped as
part of this package.</p>
<h4><a name="2.3">2.3 The OS/360 distribution</a></h4>
<p>The best source is the CBT CD-ROM, which contains Rick Fochtman's OS/360
distribution. This has not only the OS/360 distribution files, but also the
source to the operating system and utilities, as well as some useful
documentation. There are many, many other useful files and utilities
on the disk, and it's a must for anyone wanting to experiment with OS/360,
as well as any systems programmer on a modern OS/390 or z/OS system.
Ordering information is at <a href="http://www.cbttape.org">the CBT
Tape site</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="2.4">2.4 JCL and control files</a></h4>
<p>I've packed up the JCL, control files, replacements for files missing
from Rick's distroibution, and HASP installation tapes in one handy place for
downloading. Save <a href="os360ctl.tar.gz">this file</a> as os360ctl.tar.gz
in your Hercules directory, then unpack it:<br>
<code>tar xzvf os360ctl.tar.gz</code><br>
It'll create a subdirectory named os360mvt, where all your work will be
done. I'll reference the files by name throughout the rest of this
document.</p>
<h4><a name="2.5">2.5 Patience!</a></h4>
<p>This whole process will take an hour or so. On a 500 MHz Pentium III
laptop with 384 MB of RAM, stage 1 ran for me in about 1 minute, and stage 2
about 5. If you go messing around with the JCL, <strong>especially</strong>
with the dataset allocations for the target system, you won't know if
there's a problem until about halfway through stage 2, and the easiest way
to recover is to start over from scratch. The JCL and control files in the
<code>os360ctl.tar.gz</code> file produced a clean system for me; I don't
recommend messing with them until you've had a successful build, and then
only if you really know what you're doing. This was a bigger problem when
stage 2 took two hours to run, but it's still sound advice.</p>
