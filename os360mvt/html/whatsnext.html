<h3>12. What's next?</h3>
<p>There are still several bugs to be fixed:
<ul>
<li>TSO logons get S305 ABENDs if more than 8 MB of memory is in the system.
(Possibly, if the TSO region winds up below 8 MB, it might work even if more
than that is defined, but I don't know a good way to find out.) For now,
this problem can be avoided simply by defining only 8 MB, but a fix would be
a Good Thing.
<li>Earlier builds of this system encountered an S806 ABEND in HOSRDR. I
don't know what happened to fix this problem, and it might reappear.
</ul>
As we come across other things that need fixing, they'll be noted here as
well.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you join the hercules-390 mailing list if
you're interested in this system. As we find and fix bugs, that's the place
they're noted first. You can subscribe via the Yahoo! Groups <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hercules-390">hercules-390 group
page</a>. Another mailing list, <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hercules-os360">hercules-os360</a>, is
dedicated specifically to OS/360 on Hercules, and is much lower volume.</p>
