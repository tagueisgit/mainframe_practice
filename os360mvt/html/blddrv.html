<h4><a name="3.1">3.1 Installing Hercules</a></h4>
<p>Follow the instructions on installing Hercules on the <a
href="http://www.conmicro.cx/hercules">Hercules Installation and Operation
page</a>. Don't worry about the configuration files or creating DASD just
yet. We'll do that in a moment.</p>
<h4><a name="3.2">3.2 Building the MFT IPL volume</a></h4>
The driving system is a small, prebuilt OS/360 MFT system that will fit on
a single small disk drive and run on nearly any IBM System/360 or 370
hardware. It has support for the common devices pregenerated at specific
device addresses. The idea is to build a Hercules configuration that the
supplied MFT starter system can talk to.</p>
<p>The build process is performed by a shell script, <code>makedasd</code>.
This script asks for the path to the OS/360 distribution, creates control
files for Hercules' <code>dasdload</code> program, then calls it to build
the disk images.</p>
<p>The MFT IPL volume is built with the <code>dasdload</code> program. Using
the generated <code>sysres.ctl</code> control file, a new disk image file is
created and loaded with files from the OS/360 CD, in a format ready to IPL
under Hercules. Once you've run <code>makedasd</code> the first time, you
can build this volume manually, by doing:<br>
<code>dasdload -z dasdsetup/sysres.ctl dasd/sysres.150</code><br>
from the os360mvt directory, which you should have created as a subdirectory
of your home directory. This creates and loads the disk image, and makes it
almost ready for use.</p>
<p>OS/360 IPL volumes need one additional step. The modules in
<code>SYS1.SVCLIB</code> read each other directly from disk by using their
absolute disk addresses. These must be set up explicitly. Normally, this is
done by a program called <code>IEHIOSUP</code>, but we can't run it yet
because we don't have a system to run it on. Fortunately, Hercules has an
equivalent program that can be run from the command line.
<code>makedasd</code> will run it for you, or you can do:<br>
<code>dasdisup dasd/sysres.150</code><br>
yourself.</p>
