<h3>8. Final MVT setup</h3>
<h4><a name="8.1">8.1 MVT setup: MVTSETUP</a></h4>
<p>There are a few final steps needed before the newly built system may be
IPLed. The MVTSETUP job, in <code>mvtsetup.jcl</code>, does this. It
contains four steps:
<ul>
<li><code>FIXRDR</code>: The supplied region size for the <code>RDR</code>
task is too small, causing 804/80A ABENDs. The supplied default region size
for jobs read by <code>RDR</code> is too small, as well, and if they ABEND,
they take the initiator down with them. This step increases the
<code>RDR</code> region from 48K to 64K, and the default job region from 50K
to 128K.</li>
<li><code>PRESRES</code>: Remember all those annoying mount messages? This
step supplies a member for <code>SYS1.PARMLIB</code> that tells MVT the five
volumes the system knows about are all reserved and not available for
dismounting, and sets appropriate volume use attributes for them all.</li>
<li><code>SMFDEFLT</code>: SMF was included in the generated system, since
HASP requires it. This step changes the default SMF parameters to turn off
recording of SMF data to disk, so we don't have to manage it later.</li>
<li><code>CTLGMVT</code>: This step populates the target system catalog
with the datasets that were just created.</li>
<li><code>SCRTCHUT</code>: This step removes the four
<code>SYS1.SYSUT<i>n</i></code> datasets used by stage 2. They are no
longer needed once that has been completed, and the work space can
be freed up for general system use.</li>
</ul>
This job should run quickly.</p>
<h4><a name="8.2">8.2 Shutting down the driving system</a></h4>
<p>We're finished with the driving system. Shut it down:<br>
<code>p 00e</code><br>
which should return with:<br>
<code>IEF301I 00E WTR CLOSED P00</code><br>
then halt the system:<br>
<code>z eod</code><br>
which should return:<br>
<code>IEE334I HALT EOD SUCCESSFUL</code><br>
At this point, MFT is stopped, and you can safely quit Hercules. If,
instead, the system loops, go ahead and quit Hercules anyway; nothing
serious will happen.</p>
