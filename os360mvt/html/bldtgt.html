<h3>4. Preparing to build MVT</h3>
<h4><a name="4.1">4.1 Building the MVT DLIB volumes</a></h4>
<p>MVT is built by copying object files and assembling source code from a
set of distribution libraries, or DLIBs. Those must be first loaded to disk.
A real OS/360 generation was done by reading the DLIBs in from a
distribution tape, but we have an easier way to do it:
<code>dasdload</code>. The DLIBs take up most of one 3330 volume. After the
first <code>makedasd</code> run, you can create this volume with:<br>
<code>dasdload -z dasdsetup/dlib01.ctl dasd/dlib01.351</code><br>
This will create the disk image file needed.</p>
<h4><a name="4.2">4.2 Creating the MVT target and work volumes</a></h4>
<p>The MVT system will be built on one 3330 volume. In addition, two work
volumes are needed during the build process, one volume will be used
to store non-IBM datasets and HASP, and one volume will be used for HASP's
spool dataset, SYS1.HASPACE. All of these will be created
with <code>dasdload</code>, as well, and loaded with empty datasets, ready
for the gen to fill:<br>
<code>dasdload -z dasdsetup/mvtres.ctl dasd/mvtres.350<br>
dasdload -z dasdsetup/work01.ctl dasd/work01.151<br>
dasdload -z dasdsetup/work02.ctl dasd/work02.352<br>
dasdload -z dasdsetup/herc01.ctl dasd/herc01.152<br>
dasdload -z dasdsetup/spool1.ctl dasd/spool1.153<br></code>
This will create a total of five empty disk image files, ready to be
used. <code>makedasd</code> will do these as well.</p>
